            <!-- Main Section -->
            <p class="main">Second semester is finally here, which means I only have 3/4 of the program to go. Yay.</p>

            <p class="main">
                I was going to write about my Christmas Break but I realize the deep intricacies of visiting family and
                eating a reprehensible amount of food may not be the most exciting thing for most people, so I'll just
                stick with some highlights.
            </p>

            <p class="main">
                I travelled back home to Cape Breton, and it was nice to stick around for almost a whole month instead
                of my usual weekend trips I take throughout the year. As much as I would like to regale you with the
                best of the Island, my hometown of Sydney Mines is like New York—not that it's the city that never
                sleeps, but rather the town that <em>only</em> sleeps.
            </p>

            <p class="main">
                I guess the most exciting thing that happened was that I turned 20—and just my luck, I was welcomed into
                a new decade of living with a lovely thing called the Norovirus. I was out of comission for around 36
                hours but I didn't mind since I would've spent it on my ass anyway.
            </p>

            <p class="main">
                When I got back to Halifax I figured I'd spruce up my room with some new decor so that my oil pastel
                drawing of Danny DeVito didn't get too lonely. I bought some wall art, some plants, and a rug, turning
                what was once an average room into what I like to call the "Ultimate White Boy Hangout." It's a title I
                boast with pride.

            Since this assignment calls for a photo why not have a gander at this lovely photo of Layla again. She gets
            her looks from me.
