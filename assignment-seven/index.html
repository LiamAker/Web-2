                        <h2>The Book of Ashes</h2>
                        <p>A poster made for a production of “The Book of Ashes” staged by Halifax Theatre for Young People. With books playing such an important part of the play—in addition to it being targeted towards young people—I wanted to illustrate the poster with a cut paper collage feel. I achieved this by drawing simple outlines in Illustrator and adding texture in Photoshop.</p>

                        <p>In our Typography class, we were tasked with picking a font and pointing out its unique features through a type specimen poster. I chose Bodoni (specifically Bodoni Poster) for its rounded serifs and straight lines. I accentuated these features by making it appear as though several larger letters were picking up other, smaller letters by their serifs.</p>

                        <p>This project taught us that Canva is the enemy. We were tasked with transforming a horribly designed poster for the Halifax Celtic Festival into something much more palatable. An emphasis was placed on a simple symbol (with plenty of texture) being the main focus of the poster. Aptly, I chose to illustrate a Celtic knot and created texture with an old, crusty paintbrush. </p>

                            <p>As part of our Studio Practice class, we experimented with cutting linoleum cuts. We implemented these into posters for a ficticous print exhibition staged by NSCC. The figure featured in my designed is Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press. Fitting with the retrospective angle, I employed typefaces similar to those first used on the aforementioned press.</p>

                            <p>Our first Studio Practice assignment involved utilizing alcohol ink designs in packing for Wild Leaf Tea. One of my ink designs featured blots of blue, green, purple, and yellow, which I thought would translate well into steam emitting from a kettle. The “natural” nature of the product influenced me to make the packaging look hand-drawn and hand-made.</p>

                            <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a poster influenced by Swiss Design. Having recently seen 12 Angry Men, I thought the timeframe and feel of the film would suit the style well. I particularly like the photos of the jurors creating the grid, and how I was able to include all of the names included in the ensemble cast. I’m also pleased with Juror 8 being the only one highlighted in red. </p>
